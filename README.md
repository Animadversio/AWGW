# AdvanceWarsGridWorld
recreation and expansion of Advance Wars in Java with GridWorld API

With 7 new Units!

If you want to know how to play, you will be linked to Wikipedia in-game along with a breif summary of directions. 

Alternatively, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars#Gameplay

NOT IN IN-GAME DIRECTIONS: hover a tile to see its applied defense (ie defense stars, unless the occupying unit is an air unit, in which case, it gets 0 defense stars)

# Featuring :

 - Immersive screenshake
 
 - Multithreaded optimization
 
 ok I'm half joking but it actually has these
 
 - Variable refresh rate, up to 333x more responsive than the default gridworld settings! (typical improvements will be from 20x to 48x better (60hz and 144hz displays)). Choose your refresh rate from 3 (Gridworld default) to 24 (cinematic?) to 144hz. Actually choose any natural number up to 1000, as long as your monitor supports it. 
 
 - Releases, early access, and DLC for $0. To get *extreme early access* versions, go [here](https://github.com/majig12346/AVGW/commits) for really old commits.
 
# Coming Soon:
 
 - descriptions for new (custom added) units: I mean, you can kinda guess what they do at the moment, but I will release this.
 
 - cities changing color when captured: This will be implemented when I figure out how to stitch together the background on the fly, or another workaround.
 
 # Coming Soon<sup>tm</sup>:
 
 - AI player for the game. This way you will be able to play against the computer! coming soon<sup>tm</sup>
