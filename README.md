With 7 new Units!

If you want to know how to play, you will be linked to Wikipedia in-game along with a breif summary of directions. 

Alternatively, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars#Gameplay

NOT IN IN-GAME DIRECTIONS: hover a tile to see its applied defense (ie defense stars, unless the occupying unit is an air unit, in which case, it gets 0 defense stars)

# Featuring :

 - Immersive screenshake
 
 - Multithreaded optimization
 
 ok I'm half joking but it actually has these
 
 - Variable refresh rate from GridWorld default 3, to cinematic 20 (recommended), up to your monitor's refresh rate.
 

# Coming Soon:
 
 - descriptions for new (custom added) units: I mean, you can kinda guess what they do at the moment, but I will release this.
 
 - cities changing color when captured: This will be implemented when I figure out how to stitch together the background on the fly, or another workaround.
 
 # Coming Soon<sup>tm</sup>:
 
 - AI player for the game. This way you will be able to play against the computer! coming soon<sup>tm</sup> hahah At the very latest, I will get to this once my Go AI can play on par with AlphaGo.
