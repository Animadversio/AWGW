If you want to know how to play, you will be linked to Wikipedia in-game along with a breif summary of directions. 

Alternatively, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars#Gameplay

# Featuring :

 - Immersive screenshake
 
 - Multithreaded optimization
 
 - Cinematic 20fps
 
ok I'm half joking but it actually has these

# Coming Soon:

 - fps target: this will support 20,60,120,and 144 fps. A custom target will probably be supported as well. WARNING: if your computer can't handle it, it may lag more than before. Also this won't really help responsiveness or fluidity that much.
 
 - descriptions for new (custom added) units: I mean, you can kinda guess what they do at the moment, but I will release this.
 
 - cities changing color when captured: This will be implemented when I figure out how to stitch together the background on the fly, or another workaround.
 
 # Coming Soon<sup>tm</sup>:
 
 - AI player for the game. This way you will be able to play against the computer! coming soon<sup>tm</sup> hahah At the very latest, I will get to this once my Go AI can play on par with AlphaGo.
